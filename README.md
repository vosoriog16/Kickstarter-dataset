###Kickstarting with Excel

1. Overview of Project: 

	Purpose
	This project is specifically focused on an upcoming playwright, Louise, whom wants to start a campaign to help fund her play. The purpose of this analysis is to understand how much was fundraised by different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals; to see where there are specific factors that make a campaign successful.


2. Analysis and Challenges:

	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
The Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date line graph was created from the pivot table to visualize the relationship that there's between outcomes and launch month. In this line graph we can see the count of outcomes changing for months in the span of a year from January to December. The month that was most successful was May. The canceled outcomes had the lowest counts throughout the year; and October had no data available. This graph goes to show that there is a low count of canceled project per month in comparison to the successful projects per month for theater.

	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcomes Based on Goal line graph shows the relationship between the goal amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful, failed and canceled projects on the y axis. There are three ranges in this graph where the line intersects; 15,000-19,999; 35,000-39,000 and 40,000 to 44,999. These three ranges show the projects' success and fail percentage rates according to goal amounts. The highest is shown in percentage failed giving a 100% rate for the 45,000-49,999 goal-amount range. 

	Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges encountered when completing this analysis are the following: for the pivot table I had difficulty converting months from numbers to text (Jan, Feb, Mar). I also had some difficulty converting the image files to be save in PNG format.

3. Results

 	What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
One conclusion that can be drawn from the outcomes based on launch date is that it was most successful in the month of May with a 111 total count of outcomes. Second conclusion is that the lowest numbers were seen in canceled outcomes with counts lower than 10 and closest to 0. 

 	What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The highests percentage (100%) is seen in percentage failed for the goal of 45,000 to 49,999. 

 	What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation I found in this dataset is that when converting the dates using timestamp converter, the dataset is only limited to 2000 characters; it does not allow the full dataset to be converted all at once.

 	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A line graph was perfect to use in this fundraising project scenario, but a bar graph could work just as great. The bar graph can be used to to figure out how much impact has been made by the amount pledged for the span of one year (12 months); this will also show how much was raised and how the funds were and are being used. This data is effective to show complete transparency and clarity and to strategize for making adjustments on how to better fundraise for this project.
